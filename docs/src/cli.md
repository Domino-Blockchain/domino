title: Command-line Guide

In this section, we will describe how to use the Domino command-line tools to
create a _wallet_, to send and receive DOMI tokens, and to participate in
the cluster by delegating stake.

To interact with a Domino cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also
known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place the
Domino core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface is not
necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and
secure access to your Domino accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Domino Command Line (CLI) tools:

- [Install the Domino Tools](cli/install-domino-cli-tools.md)
