# Domino Program

Use the Domino Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Domino SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/domino-sdk) instead.

More information about Domino is available in the [Domino documentation](https://docs.domino.com/).

[Helloworld](https://github.com/domino-labs/example-helloworld) and the [Domino Program Library](https://github.com/domino-labs/domino-program-library) provide examples of how to use this crate.
