Some important crates:

- [`domino-program`] &mdash; Imported by programs running on Domino, compiled
  to BPF. This crate contains many fundamental data types and is re-exported from
  [`domino-sdk`], which cannot be imported from a Domino program.

- [`domino-sdk`] &mdash; The basic off-chain SDK, it re-exports
  [`domino-program`] and adds more APIs on top of that. Most Domino programs
  that do not run on-chain will import this.

- [`domino-client`] &mdash; For interacting with a Domino node via the
  [JSON RPC API](jsonrpc-api).

- [`domino-cli-config`] &mdash; Loading and saving the Domino CLI configuration
  file.

- [`domino-clap-utils`] &mdash; Routines for setting up a CLI, using [`clap`],
  as used by the main Domino CLI. Includes functions for loading all types of
  signers supported by the CLI.
